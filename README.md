# No Green Objects Game
No Green Objects is a horrible game in which you have to click the light green and get rid of it to win (no, dark green does not count because i am to lazy)

## Requirements:
Any MacOS system (sorry, but its written in obj c)

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anti-grass/no-green-objects-game/
    cd no-green-objects-game
    ```
2. Compile the game (clang is automatically installed in MacOS):
    ```bash
    clang --framework Cocoa -o game main.m
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    open ./game
    ```
